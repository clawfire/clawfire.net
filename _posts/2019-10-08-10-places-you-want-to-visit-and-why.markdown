1. Grand Canyon : because of the magnificent of the place, the glass ring, the view ...
2. Venise : Even if I went for one day, I want to have more time to enjoy the city and also have like my hotel in the city üòÅ 
3. Copenhagen : Because northern countries rules. Also, the Scandinavian design and lifestyle
4. London : ‚Äòcause I never went even if it‚Äôs so close to us geographically 
5. Ireland for the view and the landscape mostly. I could fancy a road trip there
6. Apple new HQ
7. Google campus in Palo Alto
8. Mexico City, because it seems so vibrant, and a dear friend of mine is living here, it would be nice to come and say hi!
9. Greece. Probably Athen because of the rich history of the city but I think I could enjoy also a trip to the islands like Santorini
10. Toronto / Montreal would be awesome to visit
